This repo is my personal onramp to [foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) -- a testing setup for solidity. The applications at [solidity-by-example](https://solidity-by-example.org/) are simple & some have no tests, so I'm re-writing it in foundry as an exercise.

Covered so far:
* [EtherWallet](https://solidity-by-example.org/app/ether-wallet/) ([EtherWallet.t.sol](./src/test/EtherWallet.t.sol)) - basic `assertEq` and `vm.expectRevert`
* [MerkleTree](https://solidity-by-example.org/app/merkle-tree/) ([MerkleTree.t.sol](./src/test/MerkleTree.t.sol)) - also super basic
* [EnglishAuction](https://solidity-by-example.org/app/english-auction/) ([EnglishAuction.t.sol](./src/test/EnglishAuction.t.sol)) - `vm.prank` (account impersonation), `vm.deal` (mock balances), and `vm.warp` (mock block timestamp)
* [DutchAuction](https://solidity-by-example.org/app/dutch-auction/) ([DutchAuction.t.sol](./src/test/DutchAuction.t.sol)) - also basic
* [MultiCall](https://solidity-by-example.org/app/multi-call/) ([MultiCall.t.sol](./src/test/MultiCall.t.sol)) - this was straightforward and easy too, noticing a trend
* [UpgradableProxy](https://solidity-by-example.org/app/upgradeable-proxy/) ([UpgradableProxy.t.sol](./src/test/UpgradableProxy.t.sol)) - ezpz, the only interesting part here was learning how cool the proxy pattern is (shared storage between impl, but new code to execute against it? ðŸ¤¯)
* [WriteToAnySlot](https://solidity-by-example.org/app/write-to-any-slot/) ([WriteToAnySlot.t.sol](./src/test/WriteToAnySlot.t.sol)) - an excuse to try the `vm.store` cheatcode to put mock out storage slots
* _TODO: more_


## Development

**Building**
```bash
make build
```

**Testing**
```bash
make test
```

### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:
```bash
foundryup
```

ðŸŽ‰ Foundry is installed! ðŸŽ‰

### Writing Tests with Foundry

With [Foundry](https://gakonst.xyz), tests are written in Solidity! ðŸ¥³

Create a test file for your contract in the `src/tests/` directory.

For example, [`src/Greeter.sol`](./src/Greeter.sol) has its test file defined in [`./src/tests/Greeter.t.sol`](./src/tests/Greeter.t.sol).

To learn more about writing tests in Solidity for Foundry and Dapptools, reference Rari Capital's [solmate](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/tree/main/src/test) repository largely created by [@transmissions11](https://twitter.com/transmissions11).

### Configure Foundry

Using [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml), Foundry is easily configurable.

For a full list of configuration options, see the Foundry [configuration documentation](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/config/README.md#all-options).
